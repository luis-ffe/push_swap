## Push_swap

The **Push_swap** project is designed to assess algorithmic thinking, problem-solving capabilities, and optimization skills. The primary objective is to sort a stack of integers using a restricted set of operations while achieving the most efficient solution in terms of the number of moves. The project comprises two main programs:

### Push_swap

This program generates a sequence of commands to sort a list of integers. The available operations include:

- **Push**: Transfer elements between two stacks.
- **Rotate**: Shift all elements in a stack up by one position.
- **Reverse Rotate**: Shift all elements in a stack down by one position.
- **Swap**: Exchange the first two elements of a stack.

The challenge lies in using these operations optimally. The program requires the implementation of a cost-dependent algorithm to determine the most efficient way to sort the elements within a stack.

### Checker

This is a separate program that takes the sequence of commands outputted by the Push_swap program and the initial list of integers to verify whether the result is sorted correctly.

The Push_swap project emphasizes the importance of writing efficient, clean, and well-structured code. It also serves as an introduction to algorithmic optimization and the complexities involved in sorting algorithms.
